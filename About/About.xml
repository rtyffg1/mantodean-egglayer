	<description>This mod adds an queen/egglayer for Mantodean race.
		Can be gotten in two ways:
		a) Get Mantodean egglayer at the start. Might be not easy, as they eat a lot and prefer animal products.
		b) Create an Egg at mantodean Jelly maker, or art spot. Will have to tame resulting queen/drone as it comes wild.
		After that will keep male/female spawners together if you want to get mantodean eggs or keep female separate to get more spawner eggs.
		
		spawner has a cost of 500, so they might have an impact on colony wealth.
		
		Replaces mantodean race file to remove a couple of "relative died/captured" thougts. As those seemed unfit for hive insects, and caused great drop of morale for large portion of the hive in case of losses.
